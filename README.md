## Project Description

VibeTravels is a web application that uses artificial intelligence to transform simple travel notes into comprehensive travel plans. It's designed for groups of friends (up to 8 adults) who want to efficiently plan engaging trips based on their preferences, budget, and available time.

The application solves common trip planning challenges by:
- Automatically finding attractions that match group preferences
- Arranging attractions in a logical sequence
- Providing practical information about ticket prices, opening hours, and potential discounts
- Estimating total trip costs broken down by elements
- Ensuring quality and appeal of selected locations

VibeTravels streamlines the planning process through AI automation while considering individual preferences, budget constraints, time availability, and other factors affecting trip quality.
